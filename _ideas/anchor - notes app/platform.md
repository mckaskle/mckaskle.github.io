I am working on a new product for both iOS and macOS. It is comprised of a productivity app for both ios and macos that only reaches its full potential when it has support for both platforms. I compare it to OmniFocus or Evernote in this respect; those products would be much less compelling if I couldn't use them on all of my devices. Since this is the case for my product as well, I need to make the decision as to which platform I should target first. 

My initial instinct is to start with iOS. I am an iOS developer. It's what I know.

However, a notes app with a similar problem, Vesper, recently had to shut down. John Gruber, one of the creators [believes that building for Mac first could have saved Vesper](http://daringfireball.net/2016/08/vesper_adieu). The man is smart and has lived through the "chicken and egg problem" that I'm now facing. I can't ignore his lessons learned. they lead me to consider building a macOS app first. 

i inow that regardless of which platform i support first, the product that i am biilding will be hampered until i get support for both platfroms. i need to start somewhere though. After much thought and deliberation, I have decided to make the ios app first. 

i wont go into my entire thought process since i have gone back and forth on it quite a bit. i will say that even if Gruber was right that developing a mac app first could have changed Vesper's future, my business model is going to be different. [^vesper-business-model]

i plan to monetize my product with ads. there will be an IAP or subscription fee to remove the ads as well as access a few features when it makes sense. of course, i will prefer if customers pay to remove the ads since that will be the experience the product as i have invisioned it. but as David Mith and Marco Arment have recently opened up about, this is where the market is going. i personally try to aboid using apps that contain ads but it is a tradeoff that most people seem to embrace. vesper needed money from direct purchases. i just need people to using the product. ios might not have many users willing to pay for apps, but it does have significantly more users.

ultimately, the product as a whole relies on having apps for both platforms. i cant have an mvp until i have an app on both platforms. the important thing for me to do now is to figure out 3hich features to ship at launch. i need to focus on the bare essentials and get ghe ios app out the door so that i can get to the mac app as soon as possible. 

[^vesper-business-model]: Developing for the Mac first would have improved Vesper's odds for non-revenue related reasons.  Gruber addresses these but im only focusing on the revenue topic though, as the other reasons deal with unforeseen circumstances that cannot be planned for.
