title: Shame, Optimism and Grit
---


I love building apps. I get to build apps for a living and I am very blessed to get to do what I do while still providing for my family.

I wouldn't consider the apps that provide for my family as "mine" though. The apps that pay my bills are other people's apps. I developed these apps in exchange for a salary. It has been a pretty great set up, but it still leaves me with an itch that I need to scratch.

I want to build my own app. I want a sustainably profitable app that I can call mine. Or maybe it's a suite of apps; that would be fine too. I just want a shot at being independent while still doing what I love and successfully providing for my family.

I've built and launched my own apps before. However, none have made any significant money. It's a shame.

Hindsight tells me that my biggest mistake was building the apps that I wanted without regard for the fact that no one else wanted them. I made other mistakes too, but it's not worth recounting all of my mistakes.

From what I gather, the essence of what I need to do is:

- build a thing that people want (or better yet, what they need)
- let those people know my thing exists
- take the money

It sounds simple but it might be too hard for me. I've been trying for 8 years now and have yet to succeed. I feel foolish explaining to friends and family that I'm still not making any money from my side projects. I fear that these side projects will prove to all be wasted effort in the end and that I should have stopped trying years ago.

But screw that. I'm going to try again. The many years of failing hasn't gotten me down yet. The naive optimism is still there. So is the grit when the optimism escapes me.
