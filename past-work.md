### Summary

I have lead several teams and several projects to great success, the biggest and most recent of which was a $105 million dollar deal that included the GoPro acquisition of Splice, a video editor for iOS.

I write safe, crash-free, maintainable, self-documenting code. I am an expert in many iOS technologies including: UIKit, AVFoundation, Core Data, PhotosUI, MapKit, Core Location, and more in both Swift and Objective-C.

I also have experience with other technologies including: Go, PHP, Node.js, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Java, C, and C++.


### [Splice](http://splice.gopro.com)

Acquired by GoPro in a [$105 million dollar deal][acquisition], Splice is an [award winning][webby] video editor for iOS. Splice offers powerful editing features on mobile devices yet is still easy to use.

[acquisition]: http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/02/29/gopro-shells-out-105-million-for-two-video-editing-startups/#236aa1721142


#### Highlights:
- Initially the sole developer for the Splice 3.0 redesign, I continued to lead the project as the team grew.
- Monthly active users grew from 400,000 to **2 million MAUs** from the launch of Splice 3.0 until the GoPro acquisition.
- Splice pushes the limits of what a mobile device can do with video, yet still maintains a **> 99.9% crash-free rate**.
- Aided in the conversations and processes that led to the **GoPro acquisition** of Splice.
- After the acquisition, I continued to lead the project as we integrated Splice into the GoPro's ecosystem and eventually handed Splice off to another team.

#### Technological Achievements:
- **Custom video compositor**, which supports real time playback of multiple video and audio tracks with powerful filters, text rendering, and transitions in a non-destructive way. Every frame that was played on screen or exported to device was generated by this compositor.
- Threading model built on top of GCD and `NSOperation`. The patterns used facilitated background tasks and **complex dependency graphs** while maintaining thread safety and **progress tracking**.
- Data model built on top of Core Data with support for **progressive data model migrations**, including both lightweight migrations and custom migrations using mapping models and entity migration policies.
- Custom views and controls, **custom collection view layouts**, reusable child view controllers, and reusable view controller containers. Several of these custom views utilized multiple gesture recognizers working together.

Trusted by fire departments around the globe, Extinguish manages over 7,000 building plans and 70,000 hydrants. MDT is a first response tool used by fire fighters when responding to emergency calls.

#### Highlights:
- I have been the sole developer for the entire 7 years of Extinguish's life.

- In-house, **automated subscriptions and billing** to customers.
